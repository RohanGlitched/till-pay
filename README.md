## The problem

Freelancers outside the US and Europe wait for their money and pay to receive it.

| | |
|---|---|
| **6.49%** | average cost of sending money across borders ([World Bank, Q1 2025](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/)) |
| **~10 days** | before hourly marketplace pay is released after the work week ([Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/resources/understanding-freelancer-payment-protection)) |
| **435M** | online gig workers worldwide ([World Bank, 2023](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/ebc4a7e2-85c6-467b-8713-e2d77e954c6c)) |

And if a client disappears, the freelancer chases an invoice for work already done.

## What Till does

A client opens a **tab**: an hourly rate and a budget in **AUSD**, Agora's digital dollar. The budget waits in the Till contract on Monad, which can only pay the freelancer for time on the clock or send it back to the client. While the freelancer is **clocked in**, pay builds up every second; while the tab is open on screen it lands in their wallet every few seconds, each payout settling in about a second. Either side can stop the clock at any moment, the client can pause pay or top up, and closing the tab returns every unspent cent in the same block.

**Nobody is ever owed more than a few seconds of work.**

## Try it in one minute

1. Open **[till-pay.vercel.app](https://till-pay.vercel.app)** and choose **Open a tab**.
2. **Create an account with a passkey** (or continue with email, or use a practice wallet). Privy creates a wallet; there's no seed phrase and no gas.
3. 25 test AUSD arrive in your new wallet by themselves (there's also a **Get 25 test AUSD** button).
4. Pick a demo freelancer, say $40 an hour and a $3 budget, and open the tab. They clock in by themselves within seconds; keep the page open and watch payouts land.
5. Pause pay, top up, or close the tab and see the refund in the pay stub. To be the freelancer, choose **Someone I'll invite by link** and open the link on your phone.

## Money: Agora's AUSD

Tabs are funded and paid in [AUSD](https://www.agora.finance), Agora's dollar stablecoin on Monad. AUSD supports **EIP-2612 permits** and **EIP-3009 transfer authorisations**, so opening a tab, topping up and sending AUSD to anyone are each one signature with no gas. Your tabs has **Send AUSD to someone** for one-off payments; the receiver sees it a second later, in their own currency. The in-app faucet hands out 25 test AUSD and refills itself from Agora's testnet faucet.

## Why Monad

- **Pay you can watch arrive.** Blocks every ~0.4 s with fast finality: a payout lands while the freelancer is still looking at the screen. The tab page settles every few seconds and shows how long each payout took (about 0.8 s from a browser in India). Every payout is a transaction the relayer pays for, so the pace eases the longer a page stays open, and the last seconds of pay are sent the moment a clock stops.
- **Built for parallel execution.** Pay accrues from timestamps and each tab keeps its own state. Clocking and settling never write shared storage, so independent tabs never contend; `settleMany` pays many tabs in one transaction.
- **Monad-aware engineering.** Monad charges the gas *limit*, not gas used, so every transaction (relayer, faucet, bots) is sent with Monad's own gas estimate plus a small margin, never a blanket limit. Public RPCs cap `eth_getLogs` at 100 blocks, so each tab links its changes block to block (`Activity(id, prevBlock)`) and the app reads a full pay stub with one exact-block query per step, with no indexer.
- **Live from the chain.** The site follows Monad's `newHeads` subscription; the landing page's numbers, world clocks and receipt all come from contract state and exact-block log reads.

No owner, no admin key, no upgrade path, no fee switch: earned pay can only go to the freelancer and unspent budget only back to the client.

## Proof

| Claim | Proof |
|---|---|
| Pay accrues per second, only while clocked in | `test_paysBySecondAndRefundsTheRest`, `test_noPayWhileClockedOut` |
| The client can pause pay at any moment | `test_clientHoldStopsTheClock` |
| Pay never exceeds the budget | `test_budgetCapsPayAndTopUpRestartsTheShift` |
| Invite links can't be stolen from the mempool | `test_inviteClaimCannotBeStolen` |
| Paid + refunded always equals the budget | `testFuzz_moneyIsConserved` (1,000 runs) |
| Whatever happens in any order, escrow equals what open tabs still hold and pay never goes down | `TillInvariantTest`: 2 stateful invariants over 12,800 random actions |
| Edge cases hold: top-ups mid-shift and at exhaustion, duplicate settles, extreme rates, issuer freezes, dust tabs | `TillEdges.t.sol`, 32 tests |
| Fully gasless with an AUSD permit and the forwarder | `test_gaslessOpenWithPermitAndClockIn`, plus a fork test with Agora's real AUSD |
| Every action works on Monad testnet | [VERIFY.md](VERIFY.md): 17 transactions, one per action, with fresh wallets |
| The whole UI works on the live site | `scripts/e2e.cjs`: faucet, profile, open, payouts, pause, close, invite on a phone |

## Roadmap

1. **Mainnet** on AUSD with the same contract, audited.
2. **Local cash-out partners**: pesos, naira, rupees and shillings straight to bank accounts and mobile money.
3. **Time-tracker plug-in**: any tool that knows you're working can clock you in and out.
