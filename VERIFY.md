## One tab, every action, on chain

`bots/proof.mjs` runs a whole tab with fresh wallets and no gas on either side: the client is funded from Agora's AUSD faucet, then every Till action is signed by the client or freelancer and submitted by the relayer through the forwarder. Tab № 6, client `0x828ac92115c7F12AF1C7A37265C600048dd24F53`, freelancer `0x2aAEABf549E313f2cF19d2928Ee95603C218AC0c`.

Result: the freelancer was paid **$0.350000** for the seconds on the clock and **$1.150000** of the $1.50 budget went back to the client; together exactly the $1.50 deposited. Times are from a laptop in India to Monad's public RPC, including polling for the receipt.

## Tests

```bash

forge test                                                    # 46 tests: units, edges, a 1,000-run fuzz, stateful invariants

| Claim | Test |
|---|---|
| Pay accrues per second only while clocked in | `test_paysBySecondAndRefundsTheRest`, `test_noPayWhileClockedOut` |
| Client can pause pay at any moment | `test_clientHoldStopsTheClock` |
| Pay never exceeds the budget; topping up doesn't pay for time past it | `test_budgetCapsPayAndTopUpRestartsTheShift` |
| Only the right people can act on a tab | `test_onlyTheRightPeopleTouchTheClock` |
| Invites can't be stolen from the mempool | `test_inviteClaimCannotBeStolen` |
| Unclaimed invites refund in full | `test_unclaimedInviteRefundsInFull` |
| Many tabs settle in one transaction | `test_settleManyPaysEveryTab` |
| Gasless open with permit through the forwarder | `test_gaslessOpenWithPermitAndClockIn` |
| History is walkable block to block | `test_activityChainLinksEveryBlock` |
| Paid + refunded always equals the budget | `testFuzz_moneyIsConserved`, `testFuzz_topUpAndSettleConserveMoney` |
| After any sequence of opens, clocks, holds, rate changes, top-ups, settles and closes: the contract holds exactly what open tabs still owe, freelancers hold exactly what was paid, and pay never goes down | `TillInvariantTest` (2 invariants, 128 runs × depth 100) |
| Settling a closed tab pays nothing; duplicate and unknown ids in `settleMany` are harmless | `test_settleAfterCloseReturnsZeroAndPaysNothing`, `test_settleManySkipsUnknownIdsAndPaysDuplicatesOnce` |
| Top-ups never pay for idle time and never change pay retroactively | `test_topUpMidShiftKeepsSince`, `test_topUpExactlyAtExhaustionRestartsShift`, `test_topUpAfterExhaustionDoesNotPayForIdleTime` |
| The maximum rate for the rest of time cannot overflow | `test_extremeRateNeverOverflows` |
| The forwarder rejects replays, expired requests and forged senders; a sender suffix is ignored outside the forwarder | `test_forwarderRejectsReplayExpiryAndForgedFrom`, `test_spoofedSenderSuffixIgnoredOutsideForwarder` |
| A front-run or garbage permit never blocks an open that already has an allowance | `test_frontRunPermitDoesNotBlockOpen`, `test_badPermitFallsBackToAllowance` |
| What an AUSD account freeze does to a tab (documented in SECURITY.md) | `test_frozenPayeeLocksRefundAndBreaksBatch`, `test_frozenPayerBlocksCloseButNotSettle` |

The web app has an end-to-end test that drives the real UI on the deployed site: faucet, profile, open a tab to a demo freelancer, payouts while watching, pause, close and refund, then an invite joined from a second browser at phone width (`scripts/e2e.cjs`).

## Claim to code

| Claim on the site | Where |
|---|---|
| "Pay builds up every second" | `Till._earned`: `banked + (now - since) * rate / 3600`, capped at the budget |
| "Can only pay you or refund the client" | `Till._settle` pays `payee` only; `Till.close` refunds `payer` only; no owner or admin functions exist |
| "No gas, one signature" | `web/lib/relay.ts` (EIP-712 forward requests, EIP-2612 permit and EIP-3009 transfers on AUSD), `web/app/api/relay/route.ts` |
| "Payouts every few seconds while you watch" | `web/app/tab/[id]/page.tsx` calls `/api/settle` every 6 s for the first two minutes a page is open, then every 20 s, then once a minute; it also settles once when a clock stops |
| Live numbers on the landing page | `web/app/api/live/route.ts` reads every tab's state from the contract (no indexer) |
| Pay stub from chain | `web/lib/hooks.ts` `useHistory` walks `Activity(id, prevBlock)` one exact block at a time |
